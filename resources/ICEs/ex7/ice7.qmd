Lecture Notes:

-   Rather than using absolute figures for comparison during analysis, consider deriving ratios or percentages to account for external factors (e.g. compute % of observations across total population rather than abolute raw data)

-   Pairwise plots indicate **linearity only,** so if there is no correlation, it only means that the comparison variables are not linearly related, but could possibly exhibit **other** forms of relationship.

-   Choose best optimal method (e.g. Gap Statistics) then decide how many clusters to retain

``` r
gap_stat <- clusGap(shan_ict, 
                    FUN = hcut, 
                    nstart = 25, 
                    K.max = 10, # modify as needed
                    B = 50)
```

    -   usually look for anything after 3

-   Beware of lone rangers, very unique/highly dissimilar values (possibly due to rare combination of attributes), consider removing (depends on context)

-   consider isolating input and output fields for prototype interface

-   Alternative view of clustering

    -   Parallel coordinates
