-   **Point pattern analysis** (PPA) is the study of the spatial arrangements of points in (usually 2D) space to find out if the pattern is random or the result of something.

    -   1^st^ order

        -   Density-based

            -   **Kernel density estimation:** compute intensity of a point distribution (Adaptive v. Fixed Bandwidth)

            -   **Quadrat analysis** to obtain variance-mean ratio (VMR: \>0,0,\<0)**:** measure of **dispersion** rather than a measure of **pattern;** single measure for the entire distribution, so **variation within the region are not recognised**

        -   Distance-based

            -   Nearest Neighbour Index

            -   G-function

            -   F-function

            -   K-function

            -   L-function
